# StableCode extension for VSCode

This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to use the [StableCode](https://stability.ai/blog/stablecode-llm-generative-ai-coding) to generate code or natural language responses from Stability AI's 
[StableCode](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablecode-instruct-alpha-3b) model within the editor.

## Credits

- The extension makes use of [chatgpt-vscode](https://github.com/timkmecl/chatgpt-vscode) (by [Tim Kmecl](https://github.com/timkmecl)), which uses unofficial ChatGPT API in order to login and communicate with 
it.
